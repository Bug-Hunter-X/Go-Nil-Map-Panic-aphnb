# Go Nil Map Panic

This repo demonstrates a common error in Go: panicking when accessing a key in a nil map.

The `bug.go` file contains code that will panic due to this issue.  The `bugSolution.go` file provides a solution to handle this situation gracefully.

This is a useful example to learn about error handling in Go and the importance of checking for `nil` maps before accessing their elements.
